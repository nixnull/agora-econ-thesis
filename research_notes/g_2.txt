Some details on the first three then:

Described this one in my 2017 thesis (in the library).  It reached its
peak elaboration around summer 2001, I posted a ruleset from that time a
couple months ago:
https://mailman.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-discussion/2020-January/056423.html

Basics are described in the thesis, some interesting extra economic
features worth looking at in that ruleset:  Budgets (Rules 1957-1958),
Taxation (R1917), and Bonds (a full private debt system with its own
ruleset category) and the first version of zombies.

This was a purposeful reaction against the earlier complex economy.
Designed to be anti-accumulation (one thing that brought the previous
system down is that by the time it ended, it would take a new player 2+
years to catch up with longstanding players' holdings, especially voting
power - that annoyed people).  So in this system:

* Basic unit was the kudo.  Non-transferrable.  You spent kudos to do stuff.

* There were also boons and albatrosses, which were patent titles.  You
were awarded boons for doing typical "good stuff" (officering, judging)
and albatrosses for bad stuff.

* At the beginning of each quarter, your Kudos were set to a base level
plus your (boons - albatrosses) from the previous quarter.

No way to directly trade anything, other than by performing actions for
others if you had kudos to do so.  So overall much more game-like (limited
actions per turn) than economy-like (saving/trading) - not sure if there's
a dividing line between "economy" and "game" in your analysis?  Maybe this
is a good ruleset to look at:

>>> 2004 - 2006 Cards, o-Matic, Agora the Gathering (overlap with Boons).
>>> Economy based on trading cards.

Then, because we wanted something to trade, we created a trading card
game.  Kept the kudo system as a basic currency to use, but most actions
were moved to cards.  Cards were dealt from a fixed-size deck (and draws
could be bought), hands were open, you played cards to perform actions,
and certain hands were "winning hands" if you collected them all.

This was great fun, but led to lots of temporarily-indeterminate states,
because uncertainty in a single card's play success could cascade to
uncertainty in many peoples' card holdings.  This was gradually made more
pragmatic but remained a challenge of this system, especially due to the
finite deck.  It was also notably chaotic like many trading card games -
you could make short term economic decisions during a trade, but there
were lots of "steal/discard other players' cards" cards so there wasn't
really "economic savings/stability".  Again, much more like a straight-up
game than an economy.

Here's a good ruleset, it's all in the "Cards" section:
