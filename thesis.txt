This is my attempt at reconstructing a history of Agoran economies. My main goal is to provide context for the economies we've tried, possibly illuminating what has and has not worked.

In this primary document there are some general explanations of each economy. Attached is a folder of appendices which includes proposals, reports, player messages, rules, and more for each economy listed below. All of this research is also available here: https://github.com/nixnull/agora-econ-thesis

??? ?? 2000 to Apr 24 2003 [?][2]

Description
-----------

The fungible currency, Stems, is given to players as a basic income and also give to officers. Players could belong to one of three groups, which gave them the ability to bid at one of three auctions, each corresponding to a different asset type: Papyrii, which allowed players to make their proposal distributable; Indulgences, which allowed players to remove penalties they've incurred; and Voting Entitlements, which gave players more voting power on proposals.

[Basic Income, Office Income] -> Stems

Stems -{Auction}-> Papyrii, Indulgences, Voting Entitlements

Papyrii -> [Make a proposal distributable]

Indulgences -> [Remove incurred penalties]

Voting Entitlement -> [Have extra voting power]

Tabla Rasa

Apr 24 2003 to Oct 02 2005 [2][4]

Background
----------

By March 2003, players were starting to become disillusioned with stems. Steve Gardner suggested something e titled A New Framework [3]. Throughout March and April of 2003 A New Framework (also called ANF) is discussed before culminating in a proposal by Michael titled "Of What Worth Honor". This proposal, P4486, was officially adopted on April 24th, 2003. [2]

Description
-----------
[TODO: Better explain the Tabla Rasa itself]
Tabla Rasa does not introduce any tradeable assets. Players gained two types of titles, Boons and Albatrosses, from positive and negative actions respectively. Once a quarter each player was given a budget of Kudos, which was calculated based off the number of Boons and Albatrosses each player had. Kudos were spent to perform many actions: making proposals distributable, removing blots, skipping timers for role changing, increasing eir own voting power, setting the chamber for a proposal, and so on.

Economic Flow
-------------

[(Positive) Rule Defined Action] -> Boon
[(Negative) Rule Defined Action] -> Albatross

Once a quarter:
Tabla Rasa + Boons - Albatrosses -> Kudos

Kudos -> [make proposals distributable], [remove blots], [increase voting power], [change roles], [set proposal chambers]
