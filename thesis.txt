This is my attempt at reconstructing a history of Agoran economies. My main goal is to provide context for the economies we've tried, possibly illuminating what has and has not worked.

In this primary document there are some general explanations of each economy. Attached is a folder of appendices which includes proposals, reports, player messages, rules, and more for each economy listed below. All of this research is also available here: https://github.com/nixnull/agora-econ-thesis

When it comes to naming a time period, most did not have a name at the time, or had a name that only made sense in context. For instance, what I have dubbed "Tabla Rasa" was refered to as "A New Framework", which is not very distinctive. Thus for names I have used a combination of the names of proposals, the names of ruleset categories, and my own best judgement of what elements made the currency distinct.

Defining Economy
================

In general an economy is the production, distribution, and consumption of goods, services, and currencies. In Agora in particular, it can be hard to distinguish an economy from a subgame. For my purposes here, I will define an economy heuristically. Namely an economy:

* rewards or funds the creation of proposals, reports, or other integral elements of the game. These are the goods and services of Agora, and

* involves a currency or set of assets that are ownable by all players, transferable or redeemable for the above-mentioned things, and largely unlimited in scope.

Under this definition, the early 00s land system is not an economy, because it had little to do with any goods or services of Agora. The concurrent stems were part of an economy however, being redeemable for assets related to proposals and voting.

Aug 27 1999 to Apr 24 2003 [Stems 2][2] (3y 7m 28d)

Background
----------

This economy exists as far back as the current mailing list records go. The history of it is, therefore, a reconstruction. Stems are already being used in emails as far back (in my current records) as Jan 2nd 2000 [Stems 1]. The proposal that enacted them appears to be P3897. Unfortunately the originaly version of R1910 appears to be currently lost, but all subsequent versions of it define stems. Additionally, several other rules amended by P3897 refer to stems [Stems 2].

Since these citations are not available in the current public archives, they are included in the folder appendices/stems/references/.

Description
-----------

The basic unit of this economy is a currency known as Stems. Every player receives a basic income, and every officer receives officer pay. Players chose one of three roles to belong to, which allowed them to use their stems to bid in auctions on one of three corresponding currencies. Aside from the auctions, each role also had specific powers.

[Basic Income, Office Income] -> Stems

Stems -{Auction}-> Papyrii, Indulgences, Voting Entitlements

Papyrii -> [Make a proposal distributable]

Indulgences -> [Remove incurred penalties]

Voting Entitlement -> [Have extra voting power]

Tabla Rasa
==========

Apr 24 2003 to Oct 02 2005 [2][4] (2y 5m 8d)

Background
----------

By March 2003, players were starting to become disillusioned with Stems. Steve Gardner suggested something e titled A New Framework [3]. Throughout March and April of 2003 A New Framework (also called ANF) is discussed before culminating in a proposal by Michael titled "Of What Worth Honor". This proposal, P4486, was officially adopted on April 24th, 2003. [2]

Description
-----------
[TODO: Better explain the Tabla Rasa itself]
Tabla Rasa does not introduce any tradeable assets. Players gained two types of titles, Boons and Albatrosses, from positive and negative actions respectively. Once a quarter each player was given a budget of Kudos, which was calculated based off the number of Boons and Albatrosses each player had. Kudos were spent to perform many actions: making proposals distributable, removing blots, skipping timers for role changing, increasing eir own voting power, setting the chamber for a proposal, and so on.

Economic Flow
-------------

[(Positive) Rule Defined Action] -> Boon
[(Negative) Rule Defined Action] -> Albatross

Once a quarter:
Tabla Rasa + Boons - Albatrosses -> Kudos

Kudos -> [make proposals distributable], [remove blots], [increase voting power], [change roles], [set proposal chambers]
