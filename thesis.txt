Description
-----------------

The fungible currency, Stems, is given to players as a basic income and also 
give to officers. Players could belong to one of three groups, which gave them 
the ability to bid at one of three auctions, each corresponding to a different 
asset type: Papyrii, which allowed players to make their proposal 
distributable; Indulgences, which allowed players to remove penalties they've 
incurred; and Voting Entitlements, which gave players more voting power on 
proposals.

Tabla Rasa

04/24/03-

Description
-----------------

Tabla Rasa does not introduce any tradeable assets. Players gained two types 
of titles, Boons and Albatrosses, from positive and negative actions 
respectively. Once a quarter each player was given a budget of Kudos, which 
was calculated based off the number of Boons and Albatrosses each player had. 
Kudos were spent to perform many actions: making proposals distributable, 
removing blots, skipping timers for role changing, increasing eir own voting 
power, setting the chamber for a proposal, and so on.

[(Positive) Rule Defined Action] -> Boon
[(Negative Rule Defined Action] -> Albatross

Once a quarter:
Base+Boons-Albatrosses -> Kudos

Kudos -> [make proposals distributable], [remove blots], [increase voting 
power], [change roles], [set proposal chambers]
