Steve's payment of 3 Kudos happened on 30 April, before the previous
report (on 2 May), which duly recorded his Kudos going down from 20 to
17. 

While I'm at it, I hereby pay 4 Kudos to expunge 2 Blots.

Michael.

Rule 1941 (Fees), in part:

      If the Actor has kudos equal to or greater than the fee, the
      action is performed, the Actor's kudos are decreased by the fee,
      and Agora's kudos are increased by the fee.

Let X be Goethe's kudos prior to the attempt.
Let Y be the Kudo cost of the attempt.

X = undefined
Y = 6,000,000

X cannot be compared to Y; in particular, (X >= Y) is false.  (X < Y) is
also false, but we don't care.

As Herald I confirm that Goethe possessed insufficient Honor to perform
this fee-based action.  Since the challenge took place within 7 days,
the action is ineffective.

Rule 1941 later says:

      If a Player issues a challenge as above, but more than 7 days
      have passed since the attempted action, then the action shall be
      permitted to stand.  As soon as possible after a late challenge
      is issued, the Herald shall confirm or deny its correctness.
      But in this case the Fee shall be recorded even if the Actor is
      left with negative kudos.

Question:  If the Actor has insufficient Honor, but no one issues a
challenge, then does the earlier clause of Rule 1941 ("If the Actor
has kudos equal to or greater than the fee, the action is performed")
cause the action to be ineffective?

Just to clarify:

Goethe possessed insufficient Honor to become an Oligarch on or about
Wed 16 Jul 17:07:28 (UTC).  As Herald, I confirm this.  Since the
challenge did not take place within 7 days, the action is effective.

Goethe possessed insufficient Honor to make "Default noteworthiness"
Distributable on or about Wed 16 Jul 17:07:28 (UTC).  As Herald, I
confirm this.  Since the challenge did not take place within 7 days,
the action is effective.

I issue a Private Order, directed to Goethe, requiring em to submit
a Proposal that amends Rule 1941 to make it clear that fee-based
actions are always effective if not challenged within 7 days.
