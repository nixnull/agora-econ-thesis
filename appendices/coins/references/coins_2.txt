========================================
The Game of Agora
  This Category includes Rules applying to all aspects of this Nomic.
----------------------------------------

Rule 1020 (Immutable, MI=Unanimity)
Name is Agora

      The Official Name of this Nomic shall be Agora.

----------------------------------------

Rule 101 (Immutable, MI=Unanimity)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

----------------------------------------

Rule 116 (Immutable, MI=Unanimity)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1011 (Mutable, MI=1)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists
      only within the context of Agora Nomic (such as Points, Votes,
      Currencies and any Official Records) may *not* be changed by any
      action other than those specified by the Rules.

      No two Nomic Entities (including Players) shall have the same
      name or nickname.
      (*Was: 450*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 478 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Public Forum

      The Public Forum is hereby defined as any medium by which one
      player sends or posts a message which, to the best of the
      sender's intent, knowledge, belief, and ability, is
      simultaneously sent to all active players and accurately dated
      to within 5 minutes. The terms "listserv" and "listserver" are
      synonymous with "Public Forum".

----------------------------------------

Rule 754 (Mutable, MI=1)
Spelling and Grammar Errors

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning
      or validity of such communication is not altered in any way by
      such discrepancies.
      (*Was: 435*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 795 (Mutable, MI=1)
Accurate Quoting Shall Not Be Penalized

      When a Player quotes a Rule, Proposal, Statement, Judgement, the
      words of another Player, or other references, that Player shall
      not be penalized in points for the terminology or grammar used
      in those quotes.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule
      which specifies terminology or grammar.
      (*Was: 362*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 1023 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action 
      "as soon as possible", e is required to perform that action 
      within a week, and no later than any other action e is
      subsequently required to perform.  Failure to observe these time
      requirements is a Class C Crime.  However, activity of a purely
      discussionary nature is excluded from the ordering requirement,
      and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its 
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have. 
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be 
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a Penalty.  It takes precedence over other Rules which
      define a later latest time for the performance of these actions.
      Other Rules may impose earlier latest times, and if so, this
      Rule defers to them.

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold.
      (*Was: 805/907*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 1079 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of "Random"

      All occurrences of the word "random" or forms of it shall be
      taken to mean "any one of the choices with equally distributed
      possibility for each choice".

----------------------------------------

Rule 1274/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of Indices

      Let there be a class of Entities known as "Indices" (singular:
      "Index").  An Index shall have a value, which is either a
      non-negative real number or the special value "Unanimity".

      Let Indices be ordered such that for any two Indices X and Y, X
      is greater than Y if and only if either both X and Y are real
      numbers and X is numerically greater than Y, or X is the special
      value Unanimity and Y is a real number.

History:
Created by Proposal 1274, Oct. 24 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 459 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Nomic Week

      The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday. Any
      automatic change in the state of the Game which must occur
      weekly occurs at the beginning of the Nomic Week unless
      otherwise stated in the Rules. Any activity which must occur
      at least weekly must occur at least once each Nomic Week.

The Rules
  This Category includes Rules about the Rules.  (See also
  "Making Proposals" which includes some Rules concerning Rule
  Changes, even in the absence of Proposals;  See also "The
  Rulekeepor and Archivist" which includes Rules regulating
  the Logical Ruleset.)
----------------------------------------

Rule 1021/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Mutability Indices

      Every Rule shall have associated with it an Index known as its
      Mutability Index.  No Rule may have a Mutability Index less than
      1.

      A Rule which has a Mutability Index of 1 is also known as
      "Mutable"; a Rule which has a Mutability Index of Unanimity is
      also known as "Immutable".  All other Rules are known as
      "Semimutable".

Amended(1) by Proposal 1280, Oct. 24 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 1281/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Mutability Indices of New Rules

      A New Rule, when it is first enacted, shall have a Mutability
      Index of 1, unless another Rule allows a different Mutability
      Index.

History:
Created by Proposal 1281, Oct. 24 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 114/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Rules Can Always Be Changed

      There must always be at least one Rule with a Mutability Index
      of 1.  Any Rule Change which would result in this condition
      becoming false shall not have any legal force.

      The Adoption of Rule Changes shall never become completely
      impermissible.

Amended by Proposal 1277, Oct. 24 1994
Renumbered from 1077 to 114 by Rule 1295, Nov. 1 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 111/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.

History:
...
Renumbered from 1076 to 111 by Rule 1295, Nov. 1 1994
 
----------------------------------------

Rule 1022 (Mutable, MI=1)
Semimutable Rules

      Let there be a class of Rules distinct from the Mutable and
      Immutable Rules, known as the Semimutable Rules. Semimutable
      Rules may not be Created or Repealed by Proposals. Other Rules
      define how Rules become, or cease to be, Semimutable. A Rule is
      Semimutable if, and only if, its Mutability Index is strictly
      greater than 1, but less than Unanimity.  Hence, no Mutable
      Rule, nor any Immutable Rule, may be a Semimutable Rule.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1030 (Mutable, MI=1)
Precedence Between Conflicting Rules

      There are two types of conflicts between rules: ￼ conflicts
      between rules with the same Mutability Indices; (b) conflicts
      between rules with different Mutability Indices.

      (a) Conflicts between Rules with the same Mutability Indices:

      If two or more Rules with the same Mutability Indices conflict
      with one another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes
      precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

      (b) Conflicts between Rules with different Mutability Indices:

      Other Rules define the resolution of conflicts between Rules
      with Mutability Indices of Unanimity and Rules with Mutability
      Indices of 1.

      Otherwise, in a conflict between rules with different Mutability
      Indices, the rule with the higher Mutability Index takes
      precedence over the Rule with the lower Mutability Index. 

----------------------------------------



========================================
The Players
  This Category includes Rules defining and classifying Players.
----------------------------------------

Rule 869/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Registered Players

      A Player is any person who is registered as a Player.  No person
      may be registered as a Player more than once concurrently.

      If a Player has to be identified for whatever purpose,
      then the use of that Player's Agora nickname is prefered, but
      not obligatory: *any* unambiguous way of identification is
      allowed.

Amended(1) by Proposal 1313, Nov. 12 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 113/1 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Players May Always Forfeit

      A Player may always deregister from the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse
      than deregistration, in the judgment of the Player to incur 
      it, may be imposed.

Initial Immutable Rule, July 1993
Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1290, Oct. 27 1994
Amended(1) by Proposal 1304, Nov. 4 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 103 (Immutable, MI=Unanimity)
The Speaker and Voters

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

----------------------------------------

Rule 494 (Mutable, MI=1)
Speaker Makes Random Determinations

      The Speaker shall make all random determinations required by the
      Rules except when the Rules specify another party to make the
      determination.

----------------------------------------

Rule 104 (Immutable, MI=Unanimity)
First Speaker

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1016/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Putting Oneself on Hold

      A Player may choose to be placed On Hold at any time by sending
      a message indicating such to the Public Forum.  A Player may not
      place any other Player besides emself on Hold.  A Player may
      cease to be On Hold by sending a message indicating such to the
      Public Forum, so long as it has been at least 96 hours since e
      last went On Hold.

      While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
      or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
      duties which would otherwise be required of eim, including
      appointment as a Judge

----------------------------------------

Rule 1043/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Deregistration

      A Voter may deregister from Agora by sending a message to the
      Public Forum announcing eir deregistration. A Voter who
      deregisters in this fashion ceases to be a Player effective at
      the time date-stamped on that message, and e may not reregister
      as a Player until a new Game has begun.

      Other Rules may define other conditions under which Voters may
      be deregistered.

History:
...
Amended(1) by Proposal 1305, Nov. 4 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 1042/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Deregistration Due to Inactivity

      A Voter is deregistered when one of the following conditions
      applies:

         (i) E is not On Hold, has not previously asked the Registrar
             to remain registered, and has not, for 14 consecutive
             calendar days, either sent a message to the Public Forum,
             or sent a message to another Player of a kind which the
             Rules require to be recorded in a Report which becomes
             publically available.

        (ii) E is On Hold for a period exceeding 2 months. 

      However, the above conditions do not cause deregistration until
      the condition which would cause deregistration is brought to the
      attention of the Registrar in a message to the Public Forum,
      correctly noting that the Voter is subject to deregistration.
      The Registrar must publicly verify the correctness of the claim
      to the best of eir ability, as soon as possible. The Voter is
      deregistered at the time the message correctly claiming
      deregistration appears on the Public Forum. If the Registrar
      does not respond within one Week, then e is considered negligent
      and the Speaker shall make the verification and announcement
      instead.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule leaving deregistration
      of a Player entirely in the hands of that Player.

========================================
Making Proposals
  This rather large Category includes Rules regulating the
  submission and distribution of Proposals.
----------------------------------------

Rule 105/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
What Is a Rule Change?

      A Rule Change is any of the following:
        1) the enactment of a new Rule (a "Creation"). ;
        2) the amendment of an existing Rule (an "Amendment");
        3) the repeal of an existing Rule (a "Repeal");
        4) the modification of an existing Rule's Mutability Index (a
           "Mutation").

      Additional Rule Changes may be created by appropriate
      legislation.  No Rule Change may directly change any part of the
      Game State other than the Rules.  No Rule may be changed except
      by the means of a Rule Change of a type specified in the Rules.

History:
...
Amended by Proposal 1275, Oct 24 1994
Renumbered from 1072 to 105 by Rule 1295, Nov 1 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 115 (Immutable, MI=Unanimity)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

----------------------------------------

Rule 107 (Immutable, MI=Unanimity)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1078 (Semimutable, MI=3)
RC and NRC Proposals

      New kinds of Rule Changes may be defined by the Rules, so long
      as they Create, Amend, Repeal, Transmute, or otherwise change
      one or more Rules, without making any other direct changes to
      the Game State.

      All proposed Rule Changes are Proposals.  Other kinds of
      Proposal may be defined by the Rules.  They shall be treated as
      proposed Rule Changes in all respects, save that they shall not
      change any Rule in any way, and they shall not under any
      circumstances be incorporated into the Ruleset.  A given class
      of such Proposals shall not be valid unless the Rules define
      which Player or Players must maintain a current record of that
      class of Proposals, or explicitly state that that class need not
      be recorded.

      The first paragraph of this Rule does not apply to Proposals
      that are not Rule Changes.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules describing the
      nature of Rule Changes and/or proposed Rule Changes.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1068 (Semimutable, MI=2)
Mutation

      Let there be a Rule Change known as Mutation. A Proposal to
      Mutate a Rule must contain the Declaration (Mutates a Rule),
      and, if adopted, has the effect of altering the Mutability Index
      of the Rule to be Mutated. It may have no other effects. The
      text of the Proposal must explicitly state the number of exactly
      one Rule to be Mutated, and its proposed new Mutability Index.
      Otherwise, the Proposal is not properly made. Immutable and
      Mutable Rules may each be Mutated into Semimutable Rules, and
      vice versa, and Semimutable Rules may be Mutated into
      Semimutable Rules with different Mutability Indices.

      A Proposal to Mutate an Immutable Rule has an Adoption Factor of
      3.

      In all other cases, a Proposal to Mutate a Rule has an Adoption
      Factor equal to the Mutability Index of the Rule to be Mutated,
      or the proposed new Mutability Index, whichever is greater.

      A Proposal to Mutate an Immutable Rule which proposes a new
      Mutability Index for the Rule which is other than 3 is not
      properly made.
      (*Was: 1056*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 594/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Proposals and Rule Changes

      A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes.  If a Proposal
      containing Rule Changes is adopted, the Rule Changes contained
      in the Proposal shall take effect in the order they appear in
      the Proposal.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal shall be the least Index which
      is not less than the minimum Adoption Index which would allow
      all the Rule Changes within the Proposal to take effect.  This
      paragraph yields to any Rule which may require a higher Adoption
      Index for a given Proposal.

      In no case may a Proposal have an Adoption Index of less than 1.

----------------------------------------

Rule 993/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Directives

      A Proposal may contain one or more Directives.  A Directive, if
      adopted, causes some change in the Game State other than
      changing a Rule.  No Directive may change any Rule.  Only those
      Directives which are defined by the Rules may be placed in a
      Proposal.

      If a Proposal containing Directives is adopted, the Directives
      shall take effect in the order that they appear in the Proposal,
      and according to the Rule or Rule which define the type of each
      Directive in question.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal containing a Directive must be
      at least as great as that required by the Rule or Rules which
      define the type of Directive contained in the Proposal.  Any
      Proposal for which this is not true is not properly made.

----------------------------------------

Rule 404 (Mutable, MI=1)
Legality of Proposals

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1036 (Mutable, MI=1)
Making and Distributing Proposals

      A Proposal by a Player shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker.  As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number.
      Within seven (7) days of the receipt of the Proposal, and not
      later than any subsequently received Proposal, the Speaker shall
      distribute the numbered Proposal to all Players.
      (*Was: 415*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 1061 (Mutable, MI=1)
Bonus to New Players

      For the first five consecutive Nomic Weeks following the
      registration of a Player who has not played in this Nomic
      previously, that Player shall receive 5 Points for each
      week in which e submits one or more Proposals to the Speaker,
      and any penalties which are the direct result of voting on
      such Proposals are halved; all of these shall be reported to
      the Scorekeepor by the Speaker.

----------------------------------------

Rule 109/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Rule and Proposal Numbers

      The Speaker shall give each Proposal which has been proposed in
      the proper way a Number for reference.  The Number assigned to a
      given Proposal shall be the least integer greater than all
      Numbers previously assigned, or 301, whichever is greater.  No
      Proposal may have the same Number as any previous Proposal.

      When a Rule is Created, it receives the Number of the Proposal
      to Create it.  Once created, a Rule shall not have its Number
      changed, except as specified in the Rules.

Rule 597/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Titles for Proposals

      Every Proposal shall be headed with a Title. This Title shall
      not actually be a part of the Proposal itself and therefore
      shall not become a part of any Rule Enacted or Amended by that
      Proposal. If a Proposal is not headed with a Title, then the
      proposal is not properly submitted, and shall not be Voted upon.

----------------------------------------

Rule 637 (Mutable, MI=1)
Form of Amendments

      If a Proposal seeks to Amend or Repeal a Rule, that Proposal
      must refer to that Rule either by that Rule's number or by its
      Title as given in the latest distributed Current Rule Set.
      If a Proposal seeks to Amend a Rule, that Proposal must
      explicitly state how in one of two ways: Either the Proposal
      must restate the entire Rule, or the Proposal must quote the
      phrases or words to be deleted (if any) and the phrases or words
      to be inserted (as well as the location of such insertion) or
      appended (if any). If a Proposal attempts to Ammend a Rule
      without following these guidelines, it shall not be considered
      to have been properly submitted, and shall not be Voted upon.

----------------------------------------

Rule 659 (Mutable, MI=1)
Reward Short Proposals

      Whenever a Proposal is submitted which contains more than 70
      characters on a single line or longer than 25 lines, the Player
      to propose that Proposal shall lose two Points. Whenever a
      Proposal passes that is no longer than 10 lines, the Player to
      propose that Proposal shall recieve one Point. 

----------------------------------------

Rule 748 (Mutable, MI=1)
Don't Count Blank or Required Lines in Proposal Length

      Whenever the length of a Proposal is determined, any blank lines
      within that Proposal shall not be counted towards the number of
      lines in that Proposal. In addition, any lines which are
      required by legislation, including a Title or a Declaration,
      shall likewise not be counted towards the number of lines in
      that Proposal.

----------------------------------------

Rule 783 (Mutable, MI=1)
Illegality of Bonus Clauses

      Proposals which contain clauses awarding, trading, penalizing,
      or otherwise changing the account of any Nomic Entity's holding
      of Points or any other form of Currency based on the Vote they
      cast on that Proposal are invalid, shall not be deemed to have
      been properly submitted, and shall not be Voted upon.

      deciding Rules, past Judgements, and game custom. A Judgement
      delivered without reasons and/or arguments is completely

      Such reasons and arguments form no part of the Judgement itself.
      However, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the reasons and
      arguments along with the Judgement.

      Any evidence which is used to justify the Judgement, other than
      appeals to Game Custom or to common sense, must be presented by
      the Judge.  If the Judge introduces evidence beyond that
      submitted in the Call for Judgement, e must include this
      evidence in eir Judgement.  All such added evidence must be
      distributed as part of the reasons and arguments by the Clerk of

      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

----------------------------------------

Rule 665 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

----------------------------------------

Rule 789 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

Overturning Judgement
  This Category Includes Rules regulating the overturning of
  Judgements as well as the office of Justiciar.
----------------------------------------

Rule 910 (Mutable, MI=1)
Appeals and the Justiciar

      Let there be three Players known as the Justices, and an Office 
      known as the Justiciar.  The Justiciar shall not receive a
      weekly salary.  The Speaker and the Clerk of the Courts are
      ineligible to be Justiciar.

      The positions of Justice shall be held by the Speaker, the Clerk
      of the Courts, and the Justiciar;  or by their representatives
      as detailed in this Rule.

      The Justices shall have the duty to Judge Statements that have
      been Appealed.  They shall receive the same compensation as
      Judges for each Statement so Judged.

      The Speaker and Clerk may delegate their duties as Justices to
      other willing Players if they desire.  They must do so if a
      Player would otherwise hold more than one position of Justice.

      Any Justice must so delegate eir duties for a particular case
      if e made the original CFJ, if e was the Judge of the original
      CFJ, or if e was Accused by that CFJ of breaking a Rule or
      committing a Crime.

      If no Player is willing to receive the duties of Justice for a
      case, the Clerk of the Courts shall select one randomly.

----------------------------------------

Rule 911 (Mutable, MI=1)
Appealing Judgement

      A Judgement may be Appealed upon the insistence of any three
      Players to the Public Forum.

      If a Judgement is successfully Appealed, the Justices shall each
      Judge the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer
      with each other on the case before delivering Judgement if they
      desire.  If a Justice should fail to return Judgement in the
      allotted time, e shall be fined three Points for each day by
      which e missed the deadline.  This fine shall be levied by the
      Scorekeepor.

      If a majority of the Justices' Judgements agree, the Statement
      shall be considered to have been Judged accordingly.  Otherwise,
      it shall be considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The
      Justices' reasoning and arguments shall be recorded with the
      original CFJ.

      Once a Judgement has been made, the Justices may make
      Injunctions just as may Judges, provided a majority of them
      agree.

      The decision of the Justices is final; no further Appeal of that
      Statement may be made.

      If the decision of the original Judge of the Statement is
      changed by the Justices, the Judge shall return the compensation
      e received to the Point Reserve.

Rule 908 (Mutable, MI=1)
Formal Apologies

      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points.  Within 72 hours of the posting of this Formal Apology,
      the Squealer must either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Apology be accepted, or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Aplology be rejected, but not both.  No other Player may submit
      such a Proposal, and the Squealer may submit only one.  If a
      Proposal to accept the Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject
      the Apology passes, then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

Rule 1051 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.  The Rulekeepor's
      salary shall be 5 points per week, if e is contrained by Rules
      defining the "Logical Rule Set Format".
      (*Was: 399*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 1048 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Logical Ruleset

      Whenever the Rulekeepor publishes the complete Rule Set, e shall
      do so in the "Logical Rule Set Format". In this format, each
      Rule is assigned to a principal Category, and the Rules are
      grouped according to their Category. Within a Category, the
      ordering of Rules is decided by the Rulekeepor. All existing
      Rule Catories must be listed, along with a brief description,
      whether or not any Rules currently are assigned to the Category.

      Whenever a new Rule is added, it is assigned to the most
      appropriate Category in the opinion of the Rulekeepor, who must
      choose from existing Categories. Once e assigns a Rule to a
      Category, e may not change it except as provided by other Rules.

      However, if the Proposal itself stipulates a specific Category,
      as provided for by other Rules, the Rulekeepor is required to
      abide by this, if it is a valid defined Category. Also, a Rule's
      Category may be changed by a type of Proposal defined in other
      Rules.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1053 (Mutable, MI=1)
Creating a Rule in a Specified Category

      A Proposal to create a Rule may specify the Category to which
      the Rule will be assigned in the Rule Set. Such a Proposal must
      contain a line immediately after the declaration of the form,
      "(Category: <XXX>)", where <XXX> is a Category. This line does
      not become part of the Rule if the Proposal should pass. If the
      Proposal passes, the Rulekeepor must assign the Rule to Category
      <XXX> if it is a defined category.

      The Proposal is legal regardless of whether or not the specified
      Category is an actual Category. If it is not, the category line
      is ignored. In no case does the category line become part of the
      Rule if the Proposal passes. 

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would treat a
      category line as part of a Rule.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1054/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Changing the Category of a Rule

      The assigned Category of an existing Rule may be changed by
      means of a Directive to change the Category of that Rule.  Such
      a Directive shall clearly state the Rule whose Category is to be
      changed, its old Category, and its proposed new Category.  The
      Proposal containing such a Directive must have an Adoption Index
      of at least 2.

The Nomic Archivist

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its

      Points in a message received by the Scorekeepor.

      * Transfers of Points from a Group Treasury specifically
      requested by the Vizier of that Group in a message received by
      the Scorekeepor; however, the Vizier is legally responsible for
      ensuring that such a Point transfer is consistent with eir
      Group's Ordinances.

      * Point changes resulting from end of Game adjustments.

      * Point rounding, taxation and "Welfare", if mandated by other
      Rules.

      * Point changes resulting from a premature transfer of
      Speakership.

      Point changes and reporting them to the Scorekeepor is bestowed
      upon another Player:

      * All Point changes directly related to the submission of
      Proposals: responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no
      later than the message announcing the voting results.

      * All Point changes directly related to voting on Proposals:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from Vototron contributions:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from fees for judgements, salaries
      and penalties given to judges: responsibility of Clerk of the
      Courts, who must report these as soon as possible, and no later
      than the message announcing the outcome of the judgement.

      * Electioneer per-position-filled salary: responsibility of
      Electioneer to notify Scorekeepor within one Week.

      * Point changes regarding the "Squealer/Ninny" Rule: If the
      Ninny must lose Points, the responsibility lies with the
      Squealer for informing the Scorekeepor as soon as possible.

      * Ambassador salary: responsibility of Ambassador for notifying
      Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the
      payment is earned.

      The Scorekeepor notification must be via the public forum or, if
      individually subscribable distribution lists are implemented,
      must be made on a distribution list which is potentially
      available to anyone who wishes to subscribe to it.  This
      paragraph takes precendence over other Rules which would require
      a private Scorekeepor notification. The notification need not be
      on a separate message, as long as the Scorekeepor is mentioned,
      and the message is on a list which is received by the
      Scorekeepor.

      Other classes of Point changes whose legal responsibilty for
      reporting is other than the Scorekeepor may be defined by other
      Rules.

Rule 692 (Mutable, MI=1)
Trading Points

      A Player may voluntarily transfer Points to any other Player for
      any purpose, within the following limits:
       (a) the transfer must be posted to the listserv
       (b) a Player may only transfer a positive number of Points
       (c) a Player may not transfer more Points than e currently has
       (d) a Player may not transfer Points if the recipient would as
      a result have more than 90% of the Points required to Win.

      If any agreement among Players includes any transfer of Points
      between two Players then each such transfer shall be in
      accordance with the above.  But this Rule shall not be construed
      as having any bearing on the legality or legal enforceability of
      any terms of said agreement which do not involve such a
      transfer.

      All Nomic Entities shall abide by the above limits whenever
      Points are traded.  If a Nomic Entity must trade Points by the
      current Rules but would end up breaking the above limits, then
      the Nomic Entity trades the maximum amount possible without
      breaking any of the above limits.  This Rule shall have
      precedence over all other Rules pertaining to the Trading of
      Points.

Rule 649/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Patent Titles

      Let there be a Nomic Entity known as a Patent Title.  A
      Player may nominate a person for a Patent Title by means of a
      Directive awarding the Title to that Person.  Such a Directive

      Patent Title must have an Adoption Index of at least 1.

      If the Directive is adopted, the person in question shall be
      known to all Players by that Patent Title. If the Directive

      Title for a period of 4 weeks.

      If the Rule which creates the Patent Title specifies another
      method of assigning the Patent Title, then that Rule shall take
      precedence over this Rule.

Rule 610 (Mutable, MI=1)
Default Rules for Currencies I: What is a Currency?

      Marks and Coins are Currencies.  Each type of Coin is a separate
      Currency.  Other rules may define other Currencies, but nothing
      is a Currency unless explicitly defined as such by a rule.

----------------------------------------

Rule 611 (Mutable, MI=1)
Default Rules for Currencies II: Who May Own Currencies

      Players may own any type of Currency.  No non-player Nomic
      entity may own Currencies except as provided for in the Rules.
      The number of each type of Currency owned by each player or
      other Nomic entity must be non-negative, and must be an integer.

      This rule applies to Currencies in general, and thus defers to
      rules for specific Currencies.

Rule 612 (Mutable, MI=1)
Default Rules for Currencies III: Recordkeepors for Currencies

      A Player is defined as the Recordkeepor for a Currency if e is

      Currency owned by each player and non-player Nomic entity which
      is permitted to own that Currency.

      The Recordkeepor for each type of Coin shall be the Vizier of
      the Group corresponding to that type of Coin.

      Other rules may establish Recordkeepors for other Currencies.

Rule 614 (Mutable, MI=1)
Default Rules for Currencies V: Transferring Currencies

               a Currency
            b) a player may not transfer more of a Currency than e

Marks and the Banker
  This Category includes Rules concerning the Currency of Marks
  and the Office of Banker.
----------------------------------------

Rule 1040 (Mutable, MI=1)
Marks

      There shall be a new unit of currency known as Marks. Any Player
      may possess zero or more Marks, but not less than zero. Any
      Player may give any number of Marks to any other Player, as long
      as that Player will not possess less than zero Marks at the end
      of the trade. There shall also be an entity known as the Bank,
      which shall possess Marks exactly like a Player. There shall
      also be an Office known as the Banker. The Banker shall keep an

      a salary of 5 Points after every seven days in Office.
      All Mark transfers shall be requested by a message to the
      server.

      The Banker shall send to the Public Forum at least once per
      Nomic week a report containing the balance and all changes in

----------------------------------------

Rule 803 (Mutable, MI=1)
Quantum Marks--0.01

      All Marks transfers between Game Entities must be in multiples
      of 0.01 Marks. Furthermore, whenever a quantity of Marks is
      changed, that quantity is immediately adjusted by rounding to
      the nearest .01 Mark.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which would permit a
      different granularity of Marks.

----------------------------------------

Rule 517 (Mutable, MI=1)
Marks Must Have a Source

      There shall be a limited number of Marks. No Marks shall be
      created or destroyed except as explicitly allowed for in
      legislation. If a Rule states that Marks are to be transfered,
      but there is no source for those Marks, then the Rule shall have
      no legal force. If the Rule does state a source for the Marks,
      but that source does not Possess enough Marks, then all the
      Marks possessed by the source shall be transfered, and the
      remainder of the Marks shall be transfered as the source
      receives them.

----------------------------------------

Rule 534 (Mutable, MI=1)
Order of Payment of Debts--Marks

      If a transfer indicated by the Rules is not made due to an
      insufficient number of Marks being possessed by the Entity which
      is losing Marks, the transfer shall be delayed as per other
      legislation. If a single Entity has more than one transfer which
      is being delayed for such a reason, these transfers shall be
      made in the order in which they became required by legislation.

Winning a Game, and the End of a Game
  This Category includes Rules specifying the winner of the Game
  and actions taken upon the end of a Game.
----------------------------------------

Rule 724 (Mutable, MI=1)
Winning the Game

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

----------------------------------------

Rule 755 (Mutable, MI=1)
Champions

      Let there be known the Patent Title known as Champion. This
      Patent Title shall be given to every Player who Wins a Game of
      eNomic, or who has Won a Game of eNomic. This Patent Title shall
      be awarded automatically, without need for a Proposal.

      If a Player Wins a Game despite a handicap factor X, then that
      Player shall instead receive the Patent Title "Champion*X",
      substituting for X the ratio of the Points required for that
      Player to Win, over the Points required for an unhandicapped
      Player to Win.

Rule 388 (Mutable, MI=1)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new

      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

Rule 785 (Mutable, MI=1)
Abandonment of Speakerhood

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.
      (*Was: 677*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 681 (Mutable, MI=1)
Giving Up Speakership

      A Speaker may voluntarily give up Speakership, by announcing the
      fact to all Players and proceeding according to other Rules
      governing the orderly transfer of power of a Speaker. The
      Speaker is replaced by a temporary Speaker according to the
      Rules of Succession. The Game is not over in this case, and
      Scores are not reset to 0. The Game continues until a Player
      Wins, at which time a new Game is begin and the Winner becomes
      the real Speaker.

      Restrictions: The ex-Speaker loses 10 Points immediately, and if
      the resulting Score is greater than the average Score of all
      Players, then eir score is set to the average Score.

----------------------------------------

Rule 942 (Mutable, MI=1)
Replacement of Impossible Speaker

      If a Speaker is determined by CFJ to have made further play
      impossible by eir actions or lack thereof, and the CFJ is not
      appealed within the allowed time, then a new Speaker is selected
      according to the "Rules of Succession", or if no such rules are
      defined, the other Player not on hold with the highest Score
      becomes the Speaker.  This does not force the Game to be over in
      this case, and Scores are not reset to 0. The Game continues
      until a Player Wins, at which time a new Game is begun and the
      Winner becomes the Speaker. The new Speaker shall make
      reasonable effort to obtain the former Speaker's materials:
      proposal queue, voting records, etc., but if this is not
      possible, then the new Speaker shall request that these be
      resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker is replaced in this
      manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N Points immediately,
      where N is the number of Points required for a Player to Win the
      Game; this is the Scorekeepor's responsibility.

      "Impossible" is defined here to mean overwhelmingly psychotic
      behavior, a complete lack of interest in the Game, or
      uncooperativeness of the highest order. It does *not* include
      normal Speaker latitudes which have been taken by past Speakers
      for various reasons, whether justifiable or not, including but
      not limited to: temporary suspension of proposal distribution,
      resetting of scores, or the commission of Crimes or accidental
      illegal actions. The Judge of the CFJ *must* take these
      extremely tight standards into account, and the accused Speaker
      *must* be given an opportunity to defend eirself.

      This Rule adds to the set of valid classes of Judgements, and
      takes precedence over other Rules which may attempt to prevent
      this class of Judgement.

----------------------------------------

Rule 786 (Mutable, MI=1)
Rule of Succession for Speaker

      When a Speaker is to be replaced according to the "Rules of
      Succession", that order is defined to be:

      Archivist
      Clerk of the Courts
      Rulekeepor
      Distributor
      <all other Officers in descending Point order>
      <all other Voters in descending Point order>

      When a replacement Speaker is required, all Players who are
      willing to become Speaker shall indicate such in a message, sent
      within three days of the Abandonment or resignation of the
      Speaker.  The old Speaker may not send such a message.  This
      message shall be sent to the Speaker, in the case of a Speaker
      voluntarily giving up his position; or to the first Player who
      called for the Speaker to announce his presence, in the case of
      an Abandoned Speaker.

      After three days, the Player ranking highest on the list
      of succession, out of those who indicated a willingness to
      become Speaker, shall become Speaker.

      Group may spend Points or Currencies in the same manner as a
      Player.  When Points or Currencies are to be spent from the
      Group's Treasury, the Vizier of that Group shall inform the
      Scorekeepor or Recordkeepor for the Currency, as is appropriate.

Rule 1324/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Renaming a Group

      A Group may change its Name by the means of a message sent from
      its Vizier to the Registrar requesting its name be changed.
      However, the Vizier may send such a message only as permitted by
      the Ordinances of that Group; or, if the Ordinances of a Group
      are silent on the matter of changing the Group's name, with the
      unanimous consent of the Group's members.

Rule 767 (Mutable, MI=1)
Votes for Groups

      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.
