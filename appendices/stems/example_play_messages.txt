On the fifteenth of this month, the following actions occured:

Every Land Unit, excluding (0, 0), that was not directly connected to a
unit of Aether, and was not connected by its own type to a unit of Aether,
was transformed to Aether.

(+9, +6) was transformed to Aether.


Any entities whose locations were on land units so transformed had their
locations set to 0,0.

-- No Entities Affected --


If any land unit so transformed was not property of the Land Bureau, it
became property of the Land Bureau.

-- No Land Affected --


As of the fifteenth of this month, there were 37 White units of land and
25 Black units of land. White units now have Sente, and Black units now
have Gote.


Each of the following Players and Groups is located at a unit of land with
Sente:
